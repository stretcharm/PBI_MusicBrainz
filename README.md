Test code to Access MusicBrainz API

To Try setup and email for a MusicBrainz account in EmailForHeader. Works without but you might get blocked if you use it too much

Functions

- fnGetMusicBrainzArtistDetails

- fnGetMusicBrainzTrack   IDs are optional but give better results if you have them

I used to get the full track details to complement an excel data set.
